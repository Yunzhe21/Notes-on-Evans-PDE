## Overview

- Chapter 5 Sobolev Spaces
  - 5.6 Sobolev embedding

## Before Reading
Here are my reading notes for Evans "Partial Differential Equations" Second Edition. 

I don't intend to reproduce the whole textbook, but focus instead on explaining missing thought processes in proofs (which the author might find either trivial or tedious), 
elaborating on remarks left as excercises, and supplementing with content from other textbook(s).

I also share my own solutions to some of the excercises in this repo.
